<h1>How do I go about customizing Calendar.js and add events?</h1>

To customize, and get more out of Calendar.js, please read through following documentation.
<br>
<br>

### 1. Options:

Options (which can be set when initializing, or afterwards) allow you to customize how Calendar.js will look and function. You can set them manually as follows:

```markdown
<script> 
  calendarInstance.setOptions( {
      manualEditingEnabled: false,
      maximumEventsPerDayDisplay: 0,
      visibleDays: [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
  } );
</script>
```

### 2. Event Object Format:

An event is defined as a JavaScript object, as follows:

```markdown
<script> 
  var event = {
      from: new Date(),
      to: new Date(),
      title: "A New Event",
      description: "A description of the event"
  };
</script>
```

You can add a new event by using one of the add public functions, as follows:

```markdown
<script> 
  calendarInstance.addEvent( event );
</script>
```

```markdown
<script> 
  var holiday1 = {
      day: today.getDate(),
      month: today.getMonth() + 1,
      title: "A New Holiday",
  };
  
  // This is a public function that you can call
  calendarInstance.addHolidays( [ holiday1 ] );
</script>
